            "text": "Intro to Islandora CLAW\n\n\nIslandora CLAW is the project name for development of Islandora to work with Fedora 4. To fully understand Islandora CLAW, it is best to start by looking at its contrasts to the previous version of Islandora, known as 7.x-1.x.\n\n\nIslandora 7.x-1.x (with Fedora 3)\n\n\nIslandora 7.x-1.x is \"middleware\", it allows Drupal 7.x to talk to a Fedora 3 server instead of Drupal's database. This is sometimes expressed as a hamburger:\n\n\n\n\nIslandora CLAW (with Fedora 4)\n\n\nIslandora CLAW does more than simply replace that base layer with Fedora 4. It is a total re-architecting of the interaction between the various pieces, acting as middleware for not only Drupal 8.x and Fedora 4, but also Solr, Blazegraph, and any \nmicroservices\n added to the stack. Islandora CLAW achieves this by implementing a system of \"plumbing\" using Apache Camel to pass messages between all the different parts of the stack to keep them in sync with each other. Rather than a hamburger, Islandora CLAW is a \nchimera\n:\n\n\n\n\nThis new structure has several advantages:\n\n\n\n\nParcelling out the various services and dependencies allows for more horizontal scalability\n\n\nChanging the relationship between Drupal and Fedora allows for a more flexible approach to front-end management (i.e, it need not be Drupal) while also taking much greater advantage of features available from Drupal (i.e, Fedora objects are treated more like nodes, for the purposes of using Drupal contrib modules. Many Islandora 7.x-1.x modules are redundant in Islandora CLAW because they reproduce existing Drupal contrib modules that can be used out of the box in Islandora CLAW).\n\n\nEasier to keep up-to-date as not all pieces must be versioned together.\n\n\nInstallations tools (Ansible, Docker, Vagrant) can automate uniting the pieces in a simple, clean installation process.

Work is underway to have this as a project on \ndrupal.org\n.\n\n\nWhy Switch?\n\n\nIslandora 7.x-1.x is a tried and tested product with a vibrant user and contributor community and many tools and add-ons available to customize and expand its uses. Islandora CLAW is a major departure, representing a great deal of work both in development of the software, and to migrate and upgrade existing Islandora sites. So why make the change?\n\n\nFedora\n\n\nThe primary motive for moving to Islandora CLAW is to stay current with the repository layer of our ecosystem. Moving to Fedora 4 is vital for the long-term utility of the project.\n\n\n\n\nFedora 3 is End-of-Life and has not been supported since 2015. This means that there will be no improvements, bug fixes, or security patches released for the software, drastically increasing individual maintenance needs for adopters.\n\n\nFedora 3 experiences significant slowdown when repositories reach a large (millions) number of objects. Fedora 4 is much more scalable, and is specifically engineered to be horizontally scalable in ways that Fedora 3 cannot.\n\n\n\n\nDrupal\n\n\nDrupal 8\n has been officially released and development has begun on Drupal 9. Official Drupal policy will see Drupal 7 become unsupported when Drupal 9 is released, putting it in the same precarious territory as Fedora 3.\n\n\nThe initial phases of Islandora CLAW development worked with Drupal 7 as a front-end, but Islandora CLAW has been architected with a pivot to Drupal 8 in mind from its very inception. As of June, 2016, Islandora CLAW development has pivoted fully to Drupal 8, ensuring that when the Islandora Community is ready to make the move, there will be a version of Islandora that functions with the latest and best-supported versions of both our front-end and repository layers by pairing Drupal 8 with Fedora 4.\n\n\nCommunity-Driven Design\n\n\nThe Islandora community has grown significantly since the project began, both in terms of users and contributors. For the first time, we are in a position to have a truly community-driven development process, in which any Islandora user can participate at whatever level fits their interests and abilities. Islandora CLAW has worked with the broader Islandora community to solicit use-cases, put forward prospectuses and project plans for review and editing, and has been developed with a mix of funding from Islandora Foundation members and volunteer developers working on sprints.\n\n\nIslandora CLAW is developed \nby\n the Islandora community, \nfor\n the Islandora community. As a member of the Islandora community, you can help to steer the direction it takes.\n\n\nLinked Data\n\n\nLinked Data is a big concept. A \ndefinition by Tim Bernes-Lee\n from 2006 articulates the basic idea in the context of the \"Semantic Web\":\n\n\n\n\nIt is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data. With linked data, when you have some of it, you can find other, related, data.\n\n\nLike the web of hypertext, the web of data is constructed with documents on the web. However, unlike the web of hypertext, where links are relationships anchors in hypertext documents written in HTML, for data they links between arbitrary things described by RDF. The URIs identify any kind of object or concept. But for HTML or RDF, the same expectations apply to make the web grow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse URIs as names for things\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDP is an official W3C recommendation. According to \nthe spec\n, Linked Data Platform (LDP) defines a set of rules for HTTP operations on web resources, some based on RDF, to provide an architecture for read-write Linked Data on the web. Put more simply: An LDP server is a web server that lets you manage relationships in RDF by creating URLs you can perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operation on:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://my_url/some_resource\n\n\nhttp://my_url/some_resource/children\n\n\nhttp://my_url/some_resource/children/child_resource\n\n\n<> prefix:isChildOf <http://my_url/some_resource>\n\n\n\n\nAn LDP server also lets you request the RDF graph for a resource with varying levels of additional information for discovery:\n\n\n\n\nThe resource itself\n\n\nThe resource plus child resources\n\n\nThe resource plus all other resources that reference it (inbound references)\n\n\nThe resource plus children plus inbound references\n\n\n\n\nFedora 4 is an LDP implementation. It stores metadata using RDF (Resource Description Framework), a standard format for data interchange on the web. RDF data is formatted as triples, like so: \n<resource_uri> <predicate_uri> <object_uri>\n and can be exported in many different formats:\n\n\n\n\nJSON-LD\n\n\nRDF/XML\n\n\nTurtle\n\n\nN-Triples\n\n\n\n\nWorking with RDF is not entirely new in the Islandora/Fedora context, as RELS-EXT and RELS-INT have always been RDF/XML. Related objects can be included in RDF, so it functions as a graph you can traverse in order to discover more information.\n\n\nExample: Dublin Core as XML and RDF using the dc namespace\n\n\nDublin Core XML you store with the resource.\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<metadata\n  xmlns=\"http://example.org/myapp/\"\n  xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n  xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://example.org/myapp/ http://example.org/myapp/schema.xsd\"\n  xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n  <dc:title>\n    Islandora\n  </dc:title>\n  <dc:description>\n    Islandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework.\n  </dc:description>\n</metadata>\n\n\n\n\nvs RDF (which is actually properties of the resource)\n\n\n@prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .\n<http://islandora.ca/> dc:title \"Islandora\" ;\n   dc:description \"Islandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework.\" .\n\n\n\n\nInteroperability\n\n\nIslandora CLAW works with the \nPortland Common Data Model\n, \"a flexible, extensible domain model that is intended to underlie a wide array of repository and DAMS applications.\" What does this mean in practice?

            "text": "What's Different Between Islandora 1.x and Islandora CLAW\n\n\nIn the most basic terms, Islandora CLAW is the version of Islandora that works with \nFedora 4\n. Because Fedora 4 is a vastly different platform than Fedora 3, so too is Islandora CLAW a major departure from what came before. Switching to CLAW represents not just a typical upgrade with improvements, features, and bug fixes, but rather a major shift in how objects are stored and managed. \n\n\nMoving from Islandora 7.x-1.x to CLAW requires a migration of objects, which you can learn about \nhere\n. It also requires some adjustments in how you think about your objects and their relationships, and how to manage them in Islandora, which we will cover below.\n\n\nYou can also check out some of the documentation provided by the Fedora project:\n\n \nConcept Mapping - Fedora 3 to 4\n\n\n \nThe Fedora 4 object model\n\n\n \nFedora 3 to 4 Upgration\n\n\n \nLDP-PCDM-F4 In Action\n\n\nFedora\n\n\nRepository Structure\n\n\nFedora 3 stored all objects at the top level of the repository, although presentation of the objects could mimic a directory structure by having objects 'in' collections and collections 'in' other collections. This image is a helpful oversimplification:\n\n\n\n\nFedora 4 differs considerably in that there is an innate tree hierarchy to the repository rather than a flat structure. Put less simply, \"\na Fedora 4 repository consists of a directed acyclic graph of resources where edges represent a parent-child relation\n\".\n\n\nObject Structure\n\n\nFedora 3 objects are FOXML (Fedora Object eXtensible Markup Language) documents, with three elements:\n\n\n\n\nDigital Object Identifier\n: A unique, persistent identifier for the digital object. Also knowns as the PID.\n\n\nSystem Properties\n: A set of system-defined descriptive properties that is necessary to manage and track the object in the repository.\n\n\nDatastream(s)\n: The element in a Fedora digital object that represents a content item.\n\n\n\n\nIn Fedora 4 , what we would have called \nobjects\n are now referred to as \nResources\n (and \neverything\n in Fedora 4 is a \nResource\n). Instead of being composed of XML as they were in Fedora 3, they are stored in \nModeShape\n as nodes with RDF properties. \nResources\n come in two flavors: \nRDF Sources\n, which are \nResources\n having only RDF data, and \nNon-RDF Sources\n, which are \nResources\n that are binary files (HTML, PDFs, images, audio, video, etc). The terms [\nRDF Source\n] and [\nNon-RDF Source\n] both come from the \nW3C's\n \nLinked Data Platform\n specification, which also defines the idea of \nLinked Data Platform Containers\n, or \nLDPCs\n. An \nLDPC\n is an \nRDF Source\n that functions as a collection of \nResources\n, similar to the way Islandora 7.x-1.x compound objects exist only as a way to tie together its children. An \nLDPC\n may contain \nNon-RDF Sources\n, as well as other \nRDF Sources\n acting as \nLDPCs\n; you can have a container of containers just like how Islandora 7.x-1.x can have a collection of collections.\n\n\nCLAW makes use of the \nPortland Common Data Model (PCDM)\n as a layer of abstraction over \nLDPCs\n to make containment simpler to understand for users; a \npcdm:Collection\n may contain other \npcdm:Collections\n or \npcdm:Objects\n (similar to an Islandora 7.x-1.x collection content model), and a \npcdm:Object\n may contain other \npcdm:Objects\n (similar to the way an Islandora 7.x-1.x compound object has child objects) or \npcdm:Files\n (similar to the way Islandora 7.x-1.x objects have datastreams).\n\n\nDatastreams\n\n\nIn Islandora 7.x-1.x, every object has a specific content model which defined what datastreams it could have and which were absolutely required. Some of these Islandora 7.x-1.x datastreams contained metadata about the object while others contained binary files (JPG, PDF, MP3, PNG, TIFF, etc). In Islandora CLAW, all metadata about a resource is stored as RDF attributes directly on the resource itself, whether that resource is a \npcdm:Collection\n, \npcdm:Object\n or a \npcdm:File\n, so we no longer need to separate metadata by type (RELS-EXT, RELS-INT, MODS, DC, PREMIS, etc) and store it in binary files as we did in Islandora 7.x-1.x. \n\n\nBinary files, such as JPGs, PNGs, MP3s, and PDFs, are handled via \npcdm:Files\n which are contained by a parent \npcdm:Object\n, similar to how an Islandora 7.x-1.x cmodel may hold a PDF or JPG as a datastream. Unlike Islandora 7.x-1.x, these binary files can actually have their own technical metadata attached them. This is because \npcdm:Collections\n, \npcdm:Objects\n and even \npcdm:Files\n are all \nRDF Sources\n containing only RDF data, with \npcdm:Files\n having links to the URL of the \nNon-RDF Source\n (binary file) they represent as part of their RDF data in addition to whatever other metadata you may want about the file. Using this system, a \npcdm:Object\n can contain as many \npcdm:Files\n as necessary, and each \npcdm:File\n can have separate metadata about itself and its relationship to other \npcdm:Files\n attached to the parent \npcdm:Object\n, serving the same purpose RELS-INT datastreams served in Islandora 7.x-1.x.\n\n\nNote that you \ncan\n use a \npcdm:File\n to represent a file of metadata, such as MODS, DC, or PBCore, in case you would like to preserve a copy of an object's legacy metadata when migrating into Fedora 4. These metadata files will be treated like any other binary file in Islandora CLAW, and will not be indexed or editable through the GUI.\n\n\nPIDs\n\n\nEvery object in a Fedora 3 repository had a Persistent Identifier following the pattern \nnamespace:pid\n. Fedora 4 resources do not have PIDs. Instead, since Fedora 4 is an \nLDP server\n, their identifiers are fundamentally their URIs. The PIDs of objects migrated from a Fedora 3 repository can still be stored in Fedora 4, as additional properties on the new Fedora 4 resource.\n\n\nSince resources are stored as \nnodes\n on the Drupal side of Islandora CLAW, they also have Drupal UUIDs.",

            "text": "In the most basic terms, Islandora CLAW is the version of Islandora that works with  Fedora 4 . Because Fedora 4 is a vastly different platform than Fedora 3, so too is Islandora CLAW a major departure from what came before. Switching to CLAW represents not just a typical upgrade with improvements, features, and bug fixes, but rather a major shift in how objects are stored and managed.   Moving from Islandora 7.x-1.x to CLAW requires a migration of objects, which you can learn about  here . It also requires some adjustments in how you think about your objects and their relationships, and how to manage them in Islandora, which we will cover below.  You can also check out some of the documentation provided by the Fedora project:   Concept Mapping - Fedora 3 to 4    The Fedora 4 object model    Fedora 3 to 4 Upgration    LDP-PCDM-F4 In Action",

            "text": "Fedora 3 objects are FOXML (Fedora Object eXtensible Markup Language) documents, with three elements:   Digital Object Identifier : A unique, persistent identifier for the digital object. Also knowns as the PID.  System Properties : A set of system-defined descriptive properties that is necessary to manage and track the object in the repository.  Datastream(s) : The element in a Fedora digital object that represents a content item.   In Fedora 4 , what we would have called  objects  are now referred to as  Resources  (and  everything  in Fedora 4 is a  Resource ). Instead of being composed of XML as they were in Fedora 3, they are stored in  ModeShape  as nodes with RDF properties.  Resources  come in two flavors:  RDF Sources , which are  Resources  having only RDF data, and  Non-RDF Sources , which are  Resources  that are binary files (HTML, PDFs, images, audio, video, etc). The terms [ RDF Source ] and [ Non-RDF Source ] both come from the  W3C's   Linked Data Platform  specification, which also defines the idea of  Linked Data Platform Containers , or  LDPCs . An  LDPC  is an  RDF Source  that functions as a collection of  Resources , similar to the way Islandora 7.x-1.x compound objects exist only as a way to tie together its children. An  LDPC  may contain  Non-RDF Sources , as well as other  RDF Sources  acting as  LDPCs ; you can have a container of containers just like how Islandora 7.x-1.x can have a collection of collections.  CLAW makes use of the  Portland Common Data Model (PCDM)  as a layer of abstraction over  LDPCs  to make containment simpler to understand for users; a  pcdm:Collection  may contain other  pcdm:Collections  or  pcdm:Objects  (similar to an Islandora 7.x-1.x collection content model), and a  pcdm:Object  may contain other  pcdm:Objects  (similar to the way an Islandora 7.x-1.x compound object has child objects) or  pcdm:Files  (similar to the way Islandora 7.x-1.x objects have datastreams).",

            "text": "In Islandora 7.x-1.x, every object has a specific content model which defined what datastreams it could have and which were absolutely required. Some of these Islandora 7.x-1.x datastreams contained metadata about the object while others contained binary files (JPG, PDF, MP3, PNG, TIFF, etc). In Islandora CLAW, all metadata about a resource is stored as RDF attributes directly on the resource itself, whether that resource is a  pcdm:Collection ,  pcdm:Object  or a  pcdm:File , so we no longer need to separate metadata by type (RELS-EXT, RELS-INT, MODS, DC, PREMIS, etc) and store it in binary files as we did in Islandora 7.x-1.x.   Binary files, such as JPGs, PNGs, MP3s, and PDFs, are handled via  pcdm:Files  which are contained by a parent  pcdm:Object , similar to how an Islandora 7.x-1.x cmodel may hold a PDF or JPG as a datastream. Unlike Islandora 7.x-1.x, these binary files can actually have their own technical metadata attached them. This is because  pcdm:Collections ,  pcdm:Objects  and even  pcdm:Files  are all  RDF Sources  containing only RDF data, with  pcdm:Files  having links to the URL of the  Non-RDF Source  (binary file) they represent as part of their RDF data in addition to whatever other metadata you may want about the file. Using this system, a  pcdm:Object  can contain as many  pcdm:Files  as necessary, and each  pcdm:File  can have separate metadata about itself and its relationship to other  pcdm:Files  attached to the parent  pcdm:Object , serving the same purpose RELS-INT datastreams served in Islandora 7.x-1.x.  Note that you  can  use a  pcdm:File  to represent a file of metadata, such as MODS, DC, or PBCore, in case you would like to preserve a copy of an object's legacy metadata when migrating into Fedora 4. These metadata files will be treated like any other binary file in Islandora CLAW, and will not be indexed or editable through the GUI.",

This will defend against scope creep, give clearly defined goals for community members to work towards, and present the point at which the CLAW team feels the software is ready to be tested out in small installations.\n\n\nNeedless to say, since this is a minimum product, a lot of parts of the previous prototype are either going to get replaced by an existing project to ease the maintenance load, or be removed altogether until time and resources allow other development.\n\n\nHigh Level Features\n\n\nThese are what are considered the minimum requirements for a functional Islandora CLAW that is worthy of a 1.0.0 release.\n\n\n\n\nContent modeled in Drupal as Entities using \nPCDM\n 1.0\n\n\nREST\n API exposed for Drupal Entities\n\n\nSupport for collections, images, books, and pages\n\n\nThe ability to control metadata mappings between Drupal and \nRDF\n\n\nProvide RDF based default descriptive metadata profile in Drupal\n\n\nThe ability to export/import \nJSON-LD\n\n\nAutomatic backup of Drupal content in Fedora 4\n\n\nAbility to restore/bootstrap a Drupal site from a properly structured Fedora 4 repository\n\n\nThe ability to index and search resources with Apache Solr\n\n\nThe ability to restrict access to collections and/or individual resources across all representations (Drupal, Fedora, Solr, etc\u2026)\n\n\nAsynchronous derivative generation\n\n\nVagrant\n environment for development purposes, which will serve as a starting point for more complicated, distributed installs\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIslandora is composed of four broad categories of technologies. On one end, there is the administrative interface, which users and other clients will interact with. On the other is a repository, which will hold binary data and RDF triples. In between the two are connectors, which are small pieces of software that react to events from either administrative interface or the repository. These connectors will utilize microservices -- small utilities exposed as web services either internally or out on the internet at large.\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative Interface\n\n\nDrupal 8\n\n\nDrupal 8\n provides a content management system (CMS for short) that allows end users the ability to create, edit, publish, and present digital content. Clients will interact with Drupal 8 via a browser or through a http client (such as \ncURL\n) in order to manipulate digital content. With each write operation, messages will be emitted to an event stream for processing by connectors.\n\n\nSQL DB\n\n\nDrupal 8 requires a \nMySQL\n (or drop-in replacement) or \nPostgres\n database.\n\n\nSearch Engine\n\n\nExisting Drupal 8 modules for \nApache Solr\n or \nElastic Search\n will be utilized to provide full text search.\n\n\nMicroservices\n\n\nA microservice is a small web service with functionality related to a single problem, even if it exposes just a single function. It can be deployed and configured independently of any other service, even having its own database if necessary. It can even be something that we don\u2019t directly maintain or control ourselves.\n\n\nID Mapping Service\n\n\nIdentifiers between Fedora and Drupal need to be aligned so we can trace our way from one end of the system to the other.  Implementing it as a microservice decouples this functionality from the rest of the codebase, allowing it to change or be pluggable with different mapping functions. It will utilize its own database. The ID indexing connector will be its primary client, updating the registry of IDs in response to repository events.\n\n\nImage Conversion Service\n\n\nImage conversion is a common operation in a content repository. Thumbnails, lower resolution copies for everyday access, and JP2s for use with IIIF image servers need to be generated when preservation masters are added or updated. This can be easily implemented by exposing ImageMagick\u2019s convert command as a microservice.\n\n\nText Extraction Service\n\n\nText extraction on PDFs or images of written text can be utilized to provide searching capabilities on content of a book or document.   Ghostscript can be used on text based PDF\u2019s. Images will require an OCR utility like \nTesseract\n.\n\n\nFITS Web Service\n\n\nThe \nFITS web service\n is an already existing project that extracts technical metadata and produces FITS xml files.\n\n\nRepository\n\n\nFedora\n\n\nFedora 4\n houses binary content along with RDF triples for metadata about repository content. It also conforms to the \nLDP\n specification, allowing for manipulation of relationships through HTTP operations.\n\n\nAPI-X\n\n\nAPI-X\n allows Islandora to extend the Fedora 4 API.  Microservices are registered in API-X and then \u2018bound\u2019 to repository content. A proxy sitting in front of Fedora exposes microservices as functions on repository content, which all HTTP requests must be routed through.  \n\n\nFor example, suppose Islandora is running the FITS web service described above.  Then let\u2019s say we \u2018bind\u2019 it to all binaries in Fedora, with an identifier of \u2018fits\u2019. If we have a binary file at \nhttp://fedora-host.com/fcrepo/rest/binaries/example\n, then instead of writing code to retreive the content and forward it to our FITS service, we simply visit the proxy at \nhttp://apix-host.com/fcrepo/rest/binaries/example/fits\n. \n\n\nSince services can be described, and that information is made available to interested clients, other applications can make informed decisions about what services are available for particular resources.\n\n\nTriplestore\n\n\nRDF content is indexed in a \nSPARQL\n 1.1 compliant triplestore.\n\n\nConnectors\n\n\nConnectors are small programs that listen to the event streams of either the Fedora repository or Drupal. In response to events, they perform actions, often bridging two pieces of technology together (like indexing a triplestore, hence \u2018connectors\u2019). \nApache Camel\n is a natural fit for these types of programs.\n\n\nConnectors will often delegate larger chunks of work to microservices, either bound to content through API-X or used stand-alone. They are primarily concerned with guaranteeing that events are responded to in a \nidempotent\n fashion.  Due to the nature of asynchronous messaging, certain guarantees, such as timeliness of delivery, cannot be made.  So connectors may need to retry a couple of times, or know to ignore a message that\u2019s delivered late or applied twice.  This is why it\u2019s important that operations are idempotent.\n\n\nID Indexer\n\n\nA connector will listen to Fedora events and index unique IDs contained in RDF using the ID Mapping microservice. The predicate used to notate unique IDs can be controlled through configuration. \n\n\nTriplestore Indexer\n\n\nA connector will listen to Fedora events and index RDF in a SPARQL 1.1 triplestore. This is provided by the Fedora community as part of the \nfcrepo-camel-toolbox\n project.\n\n\nSync\n\n\nA sub-project of \nAlpaca\n that provides two connectors for keeping information between Fedora and Drupal in sync. One, which indexes content in Fedora from Drupal events, is always running. The other, which indexes content in Drupal based on state in Fedora, is manually triggered through a re-indexing process like other fcrepo-camel-toolbox connectors.\n\n\nAlpaca\n\n\nAlpaca\n responds to creation and update events for binary files and creates derivative files based on the microservices it finds available for that type of binary in API-X. Derivatives are then ingested into Drupal, with Sync making sure they get flushed back to Fedora.\n\n\nRequest Flows\n\n\nHere are the proposed flows for all the different types of requests you can make against repository objects.\n\n\nRead a Resource\n\n\nSuppose a client views a resource in Islandora through their browser. A request is made to Drupal, which looks up the resource in an SQL database, and its representation is returned to the user.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Resource\n\n\nSuppose a client submits a form to create a new Resource, or provides a json-ld or binary representation to an entity REST endpoint. The supplied representation is used to create an entity in Drupal. In response to the entity being saved, an event is emitted with supplied representation as the body. The response is then sent back to the client. If using a browser, the client should be redirected to the newly created resource.  \n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sync will receive the creation event, and ingest the supplied representation in Fedora. Fedora will then emit a creation event.  \n\n\n\n\nThe ID Mapping connector will react, retrieving the Fedora representation and extracting an ID out of the RDF. That ID will be indexed in the ID Mapping microservice.\n\n\n\n\nThe triple store connector will also react, retrieving RDF and indexing it in the triple store.\n\n\n\n\nIf the node created was a preservation master, then Alpaca will respond by inspecting the list of derivative generation services bound as extensions on the preservation master in API-X. Each will be invoked, with the new resource getting ingested into Drupal.  \n\n\n\n\nThe process repeats itself again, with new events being emitted for the new entities getting created in Drupal. Sync responds and ingests the derivatives into Fedora.\n\n\n\n\nFedora emits the creation events, but since none are a preservation master, Alpaca does not respond and the cycle is broken.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate a Resource\n\n\nSuppose a client submits a form to update a new Resource, or provides a json-ld or binary representation to an entity REST endpoint.  In response to the entity being saved, an event is emitted with supplied representation as the body. The response is then sent back to the client.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sync will receive the update event, and apply it against the representation in Fedora. Fedora will then emit an update event.  \n\n\n\n\nThe triple store connector will also react, retrieving RDF and indexing it in the triple store.\n\n\n\n\nIf a binary of a presentation master was updated, then Alpaca will respond by inspecting the list of derivative generation services bound as extensions on the preservation master in API-X. Each will be invoked, with the new resource overwriting its predecessor in Drupal.\n\n\n\n\nThe process repeats itself again, with new events being emitted for the derivative entities getting updated in Drupal. Sync responds and ingests the derivatives into Fedora.\n\n\n\n\nFedora emits the creation events, but since none are a preservation master, Alpaca does not respond and the cycle is broken.\n\n\n\n\nDelete a Resource\n\n\nSuppose a client deletes a resource through the browser or API. In response to the entity being deleted, an event is emitted. The response is then sent back to the client.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sync will receive the delete event, and remove the corresponding resource in Fedora.\n\n\n\n\nThe ID Mapping connector will respond to the delete event by removing the resource\u2019s entry.\n\n\n\n\nThe triple store connector will also respond, deleting all triples with subject of the resource.\n\n\n\n\nContent Modeling in Fedora\n\n\nDescriptive metadata will be RDF properties, and a default dcterms descriptive metadata application profile will be created.\n\n\nTechnical metadata will be RDF properties, and follow the Hydra/Islandora led \ntechnical metadata application profile\n.\n\n\nHere are Turtle snippets representing the default collection, object, and file types.\n\n\nCollection\n\n\n<>  a pcdm:Collection   .\ndc:title \u201cCollection Title\u201d .\n    dc:description \u201cCollection description\u201d .\n    \u2026 other descriptive metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n<>  a pcdm:Object, schema:ImageObject .\n    pcdm:memberOf <someCollection>\n    dc:title \u201cImage Title\u201d .\n    dc:description \u201cImage description\u201d .\n    \u2026 other descriptive metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nImage Preservation Master File\n\n\n<>  a pcdmuse:PreservationMasterFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf <someImage>\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/jpeg\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nImage Service File\n\n\n<>  a pcdmuse:ServiceFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf <someImage>\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/jpeg\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nImage Thumbnail File\n\n\n<>  a pcdmuse:ThumbnailImage .\n    pcdm:fileOf <someImage>\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/png\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nBook\n\n\n<>  a pcdm:Object, schema:Book .\n    pcdm:memberOf <someCollection>\niana:first <firstPageProxy>\niana:last <lastPageProxy>\n    dc:title \u201cBook Title\u201d .\n    dc:description \u201cBook description\u201d .\n    \u2026 other descriptive metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage\n\n\n<>  a pcdm:Object, schema:ImageObject .\n    pcdm:memberOf <someBook>\n    dc:title \u201cPage Title\u201d .\n    dc:description \u201cPage description\u201d .\n    \u2026 other descriptive metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage Proxy\n\n\n<>  a ore:Proxy\n    ore:proxyFor <somePage>\n    ore:proxyIn <someBook>\n    iana:prev <prevPageProxy>\n    iana:next <nextPageProxy>\n\n\n\n\nPage Preservation Master File\n\n\n<>  a pcdmuse:PreservationMasterFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf <somePage>\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/tiff\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage Intermediate File\n\n\n<>  a pcdmuse:IntermediateFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf <somePage>\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/jp2\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage Service File\n\n\n<>  a pcdmuse:ServiceFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf <somePage>\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/jpeg\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage Thumbnail File\n\n\n<>  a pcdmuse:ThumbnailImage .\n    pcdm:fileOf <somePage>\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/png\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nDrupal 8\n\n\nObjects will be modeled using \ncontent entities\n in Drupal 8. The content entities store their metadata as Drupal fields, which are mapped to RDF using an \nrdf mapping\n. An RDF mapping not only allows metadata to be transformed into json-ld, but it also controls which properties from Drupal get preserved in Fedora.\n\n\nFiles will be modeled using \nmedia entities\n. Media entities attempt to provide the base storage component for the Drupal 8. They can model any type of media, including local files, YouTube\nvideos, Tweets, Instagram photos, etc\u2026\n\n\nIngests and edits can be done for an entire graph of entities using \ninline entity forms\n. Although flushing back to Fedora happens at the per-Resource level, using inline entity forms makes the \nnamed graph\n the default unit of work for a repository architect.\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example of what an ingest form could look like using inline entity forms:\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the entities required to meet our goals. Each of these entities must have basic RESTful CRUD operations exposed for clients.\n\n\n\n\nRdfResource\n\n\nNonRdfResource\n\n\nProxy\n\n\nObject\n\n\nFile\n\n\nCollection\n\n\nImage\n\n\nPage\n\n\nBook\n\n\n\n\nIndividual entities and named graphs can be imported and exported in \njson-ld format\n using \njson-ld contexts\n.",

They are grouped together as features and deployed to Karaf container.\n\n\nOSGi\n\n\nOSGi is a specification to develop and deploy modular Java applications. It allows for dynamic deployment (hot deployment) and dependency management. \n\n\nThe base unit of resources is called a bundle. Bundle is similar to a jar file, with additional information to be processed as an OSGi component. Several bundles can be grouped together into a Feature and installed together. OSGi bundles can be run on containers implementing the OSGi specification. Apache Karaf is one such container\n\n\nKaraf\n\n\nApache Karaf is a container that can be used to deploy an array of applications such servlets, Apache Camel components, jars etc. \n\n\nKaraf - Bundle - Hello World\n\n\nDownload a bundle to the \nCLAW vagrant\n (ex to \n/home/ubuntu\n directory). An example hello world bundle is \nhere\n. \n\n\nIn Islandora CLAW vagrant, you can login to Karaf using ssh. The password is karaf. You can also use the client here: \n/opt/karaf/bin/client\n. Karaf client allows the use of linux commands such as \ngrep\n in addition to Karaf commands.  \n\n\nssh -p 8101 karaf@localhost\n\n\n\n\nInstall the bundle:\n\n\nkaraf@root()> bundle\nkaraf@root(bundle)> install file:///home/ubuntu/helloworld-1.0.0.jar\nBundle ID: 242\n\n\n\n\nThe installation will return a bundle id. You can issue the list command to verify that bundle is on the list. Initially it will have \nInstalled\n status.\n\n\nAs per OSGi specification, before a bundle can be started, it has to be Resolved. To resolve, issue the following command.  \n\n\nkaraf@root(bundle)> resolve 242\n\n\n\n\nYou can start and stop the bundle as below.\n\n\nkaraf@root(bundle)> start 242\nHello World!\nkaraf@root(bundle)> stop 242\nGoodbye World!\nkaraf@root(bundle)> \n\n\n\n\nKaraf - Features - Hello World\n\n\nKaraf Features allows for bundles to be grouped, managed and deployed together. Features can be nested as well. Feature files of frameworks such as Apache Camel or Apache ActiveMQ can be used to deploy those services.  \n\n\nA simple Features file is as below.  \n\n\n<features>\n  <feature name='greeter_server' version='1.0'>\n    <bundle>file:///home/ubuntu/helloworld-1.0.0.jar</bundle>\n    <bundle>file:///home/ubuntu/helloworld2-1.0.0.jar</bundle>\n  </feature>\n</features>\n\n\n\n\nYou can add the features to Karaf as below:\n\n\nkaraf@root()> feature:repo-add file:///home/ubuntu/features.xml\n\n\n\n\nYou can install the feature's bundles as below.  \n\n\nkaraf@root(feature)> install greeter_server\nHello World 2 !\nHello World!\n\n\n\n\nUninstalling the feature.\n\n\nkaraf@root(feature)> uninstall greeter_server\nGoodbye World 2 !\nGoodbye World!\n\n\n\n\n\nGradle\n\n\nGradle is used by Alpaca as a build and package management tool. It is similar to \nMaven\n.  \n\n\nApache Camel\n\n\nApache Camel is an integration framework that aids in implementing integration patterns.  \n\n\nAlpaca - Apache Camel HelloWorld\n\n\nMaven has camel-archetype-blueprint which can be used to create apache-camel OSGi bundle project structure.  \n\n\nCreating a project/bundle under Alpaca\n\n\nmvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-blueprint -DarchetypeVersion=2.9.0 -DarchetypeRepository=https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots-g\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is easier to copy the structure of an existing project such as \nislandora-connector-broadcast\n.\n\n\ncp -R islandora-connector-broadcast/ islandora-connector-helloworld\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the project in your IDE. In Eclipse, you can go to File | Open Projects from File System and navigate the new folder.  \n\n\nWe need to rename the configuration, java and build files to reflect the helloworld project.  \n\n\n\n\nsrc/main/cfg/ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.helloworld.cfg\n\n\nsrc/main/java/ca/islandora/alpaca/connector/helloworld\n\n\nsrc/main/java/ca/islandora/alpaca/connector/helloworld/HelloworldRouter.java\n\n\n\n\nAlso change the content of the above file to log Hello World\n\n\npackage ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.helloworld;\n\nimport static org.apache.camel.LoggingLevel.INFO;\n\nimport org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\n\npublic class HelloworldRouter extends RouteBuilder {\n\n    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HelloworldRouter.class);\n\n    /**\n     * Configure the message route workflow.\n     */\n    public void configure() throws Exception {\n\n        // Hello World.\n        from(\"timer:foo?period=5000\").log(INFO, LOGGER, \"Hello World\");\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsrc/main/resource/OSGI-INF/blueprint/blueprint.xml\n - Change the content of this file to reflect Helloworld package.  \n\n\nsrc/build.gradle\n\n\n\n\napply plugin: 'osgi'\n\ndescription = 'Islandora CLAW HelloWorld'\n\ndependencies {\n    compile group: 'org.apache.camel', name: 'camel-core', version: camelVersion\n    compile group: 'org.apache.camel', name: 'camel-blueprint', version: camelVersion\n    compile group: 'org.apache.activemq', name: 'activemq-camel', version: activemqVersion\n    compile group: 'org.slf4j', name: 'slf4j-api', version: slf4jVersion\n    testCompile group: 'org.apache.camel', name: 'camel-test-blueprint', version: camelVersion\n}\n\njar {\n    manifest {\n        description project.description\n        docURL project.docURL\n        vendor project.vendor\n        license project.license\n\n        instruction 'Import-Package', 'org.apache.activemq.camel.component,' +\n                            \"org.apache.camel;version=\\\"${camelVersionRange}\\\",\" +\n                            defaultOsgiImports\n        instruction 'Export-Package', 'ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.helloworld'\n    }\n}\n\nartifacts {\n    archives (file('build/cfg/main/ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.helloworld.cfg')) {\n        classifier 'configuration'\n        type 'cfg'\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the bundle\n\n\nTo build this project, we have to update the Alpaca build settings. Include and add the project in \nAlpaca/settings.gradle\n.\n\n\ninclude ':islandora-connector-helloworld'\nproject(':islandora-connector-helloworld').projectDir = \"$rootDir/islandora-connector-helloworld\" as File\n\n\n\n\nNormally, we would also have to update the \nkaraf/src/main/resources/features.xml\n file to include this bundle. However, we will be deploying the bundle directly into Karaf's Hot deployment directory. Thus, not needed at this time.\n\n\nTo build it from command line in Linux.\n\n\nubuntu:~/workspace/Alpaca$ sudo gradle w build\n\n\n\n\nDeploying the bundle\n\n\n\n\nUpload the bundle to the Apache Karaf deploy directory: \n/opt/apache-karaf-4.0.5/deploy\n\n\nLogin to Karaf. You can also use the Karaf client here: \n/opt/karaf/bin/client\n.\n\n\n\n\nssh -p 8101 karaf@localhost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that bundle is deployed\n\n\n\n\nbundle:list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the log to confirm that the bundle is working.\n\n\n\n\nlog:tail\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a message like below:\n\n\n2017-02-24 21:30:17,973 | INFO  | 12 - timer://foo | HelloworldRouter                 | 186 - ca.islandora.alpaca.islandora-connector-helloworld - 0.2.1.SNAPSHOT | Hello World\n\n\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ is a JMS compliant Messaging Queue. Messaging client can make use of JMS to send messages.\n\n\nInstalling ActiveMQ\n\n\nInstalling ActiveMQ is relatively easy. Download the latest stable release \nhere\n. Go to the \nactivemq_install_dir/bin\n. Start the ActiveMQ by using the activemq script or batch file and start command.\n\n\n$ cd activemq_install_dir/bin\n$ ./activemq start\n\n\n\n\nWhen ActiveMQ gets started, go to http://localhost:8161/admin/. You can login using admin:admin.\n\n\nNote that ActiveMQ in CLAW vagrant does not have a UI.  \n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nOSGI for Beginners\n\n\nPlaying with Apache Karaf Console\n\n\nKaraf Quick Start\n\n\nActiveMQ Introduction",

Your host machine will need to be able to support the additional memory use. You can override the CPU and RAM allocation by creating \nISLANDORA_VAGRANT_CPUS\n and \nISLANDORA_VAGRANT_MEMORY\n environment variables and setting the values. For example, on an Ubuntu host you could add to \n~/.bashrc\n:\n\n\nexport ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_CPUS=4\nexport ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_MEMORY=4096\n\n\n\n\nHostname and Description\n\n\nIf you use a DNS or host file management plugin with Vagrant, you may want to set a specific hostname for the virtual machine. You can do that with the \nISLANDORA_VAGRANT_HOSTNAME\n variable.  The \nISLANDORA_VAGRANT_VIRTUALBOXDESCRIPTION\n variables can be used to track the VM build.

The \ninstall\n directive is the default, so all one has to do is navigate to the appropriate directory and issue a \nmvn\n in the command line.  For example, to compile the collection service:\n\n\n~ $ cd /path/to/CLAW/Alpaca/services/collection-service\n/path/to/CLAW/Alpaca/serices/collection-service $ mvn\n\n\n\n\nThe only caveat here is that this is best done on the virtual machine itself. While your virtual machine was being built, it's Karaf installation was set to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository for changes, and autodeploy in response to \nmvn install\n. So while you can always run Maven from your own machine, it will get installed in your personal Maven repository on your machine. So to take advantage of the auto-redeploy capabilities of Karaf, you need to do this as the vagrant user.\n\n\nIf for any reason, you have to shutdown or restart Karaf, it will cease to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository. In order to turn this back on, you'll have to issue the appropriate commands to get monitoring working again.
