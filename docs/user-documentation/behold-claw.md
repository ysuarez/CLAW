##SYSTEM ANALOGIES
###Drupal 8 (drupal-project)
* Drupal is the interface for Islandora, and in CLAW, Drupal provides an even-more crucial role. In fact, if an Islandora site was a physical building, Drupal would be everything above ground. Drupal is a modular system, and Islandora is comprised of modules, plugins that allow integration with Islandora’s other components. User Management, Content Creation, Theming, Menus, and all elements of access and dissemination are managed in Drupal. Of particular note is that search is provided in Drupal through the Search API. This means that Islandora leverages Drupal’s pre-existing search product integrations, including modules for connecting to Solr (Apache Solr) and modules for connecting to Elastic Search.
